VncSharp
--------

VncSharp is a Free and Open Source (GPL) implementation of the VNC Remote Framebuffer (RFB) Protocol for the .NET Framework. VNC (Virtual Network Computing) is a cross-platform client/server protocol allowing remote systems to be controlled over a network. VNC was originally developed at AT&T Laboratories in Cambridge and is now being developed by RealVNC in the UK. You can download VNC clients and servers from RealVNC's website, or from a number of other parallel development projects.

VncSharp is a VNC Client Library and custom Windows Forms Control. VncSharp is also Free Software, released under the GPL. You can freely use VncSharp to bundle VNC functionality into your own .NET applications simply by dragging and dropping a control onto your form. You can download the binaries and source code on the Download page.
