# Terminals Project
Terminals is a secure, multi tab terminal services/remote desktop client. RDP, VNC, VMRC, SSH, Telnet, RAS, ICA Citrix, HTTP and HTTPs based protocols are integrated. It uses Terminal Services ActiveX Client (mstscax.dll). The project started from the need of controlling multiple connections simultaneously. It is a complete replacement for the mstsc.exe (Terminal Services) client. This is official source moved from Codeplex. See [features list](/Docs/Features-and-Screen-shots.md)
